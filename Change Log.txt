GENERAL CHANGES
-The File dropdown menu option "New Character" now clears the entire Planner to allow for easy creation of a new character.

-The File dropdown menu option "Save Character As ..." lets the user save their work in the Planner to a .txt file. This file will contain the character's profession, race, base statistics, skills build, and all maneuver builds. No calculation are saved to this file.
-Removed the Character.py file. The contents of this file where combined into globals.py
-A large amount of code was moved from other .py files into the Character class now located in globals.py to allow for easier access by all Planner files and for save/loading character files.

-The Planner can no longer be resized or maximized.
-When a popup box appear on any panel, you can no longer interact with the main Planner GUI until the popup box closes.
-Fixed a lot of errors in the GS4 SQL database.

STATISTICS PANEL CHANGES
-You can use the Up and Down arrows to move between the statistic boxes.
-Changing professions no longer makes the Planner lag for 2-3 seconds.

SKILLS PANEL CHANGES
-Calculating a character's build has been redone and improved. In addition to allow users to use a rate (2x, 1.5x, etc) for a skill goal, user can specify the number of ranks they want total. (ie 24 ranks of Arcane Symbols)
-The Planner will attempt to train in as many skills each level but will stop if it cannot fully train all the ranks in each skill. For rates this is the calculated number for that level (2x is 2 ranks, 1.5x might be 1 or 2 ranks) while numbers are ALL the ranks. If the Planner does stop because it can't train all the ranks, a push back occurs. This will move all remaining untrained ranks for that skill and all the ranks for EVERY SKILL below it on the training schedule will be moved to the next level, combining them with any existing training at that level. In short, if you can't train everything, the planner will keep trying every level until you can train all the ranks or you exceed a target level in a skill.
-Calculating a build that cannot achieve all the ranks of a skill in its indicated level range will cause an error box to appear to inform the user. This also aborts any further skill schedule calculations.
-The schedule calculation takes skill subgroups (Spell Research, everything that falls under a specific Lore) into consideration when determine skill costs and max ranks.
-You can use the mouse wheel to scroll in the build and schedule frames if they contain enough data.

MANEUVER PANEL CHANGES
-Similar to the Skills Panel, this panel will use a push back if it cannot train every rank for a maneuver at a given level.
-The schedule calculation takes maneuver prerequisites into consideration when determining if you can train in a maneuver. This will trigger a push back and will try again each level until it can train all the ranks or it ends with an error.
-You can use the mouse wheel to scroll in the build and schedule frames if they contain enough data.
